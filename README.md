ArmStrongPrinter
================

The first arm specific 3d printing firmware that I know of. It is currently capable of parsing gcode and turning it into code that an ARM fiq can use to move the stepper motors. It also has the ability to compress the data. Doing so significantly reduces the file sizes.
